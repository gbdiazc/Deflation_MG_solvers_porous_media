# Comparison of Linear Solvers for Incompressible Highly Heterogeneous Reservoirs

This repository contains the numerical solvers used in the research paper:

**"Comparison of linear solvers for incompressible fluid in highly heterogeneous reservoirs"**  
G.B. Díaz-Cortés, L.A. López-Peña, and C. Vuik.

The code provides implementations of linear solvers and preconditioning strategies designed for pressure systems arising from incompressible flow in strongly heterogeneous porous media.



The repository focuses on the following solvers:

- Deflation techniques
- Multigrid (MG) methods
- Hybrid Deflation + Multigrid strategies

The test problems represent layered porous media with strong permeability contrasts, mimicking fractured or clay-rich reservoir formations.
